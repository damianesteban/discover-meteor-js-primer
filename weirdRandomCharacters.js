// Weird Random Characters
// In JS you'll often encounter stuff liek this:
$('body').addClass('loaded');
//or:
_.shuffle([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]);

// In the above examples, "$" and "_" are user-defined variable names!
// That is wacky as shit!
// $() is commonly used as an alias for the jQuery function, and _
// is the main object of the Underscore library.
