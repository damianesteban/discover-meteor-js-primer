// Operators
// = is the assignment operator.  This means that:
// a = 12;
// means "assign the value 12 to a".
// To compare two values, you would use ==
// a == 12;
// JavaScript also features the === operator, which compares both
// value and type (i.e. string, integer, etc.):
var a = 12;
console.log(a == 12); // true
console.log(a === 12); // false

// NOTE: According to this tutorial, the statements should return what
// what is indicated above.  However, the second statement also returns true.
