// Let's declare some variables in JS.
var a;
var a = 12;

// or like this:
b = 12;

// Why would you want to do it like this?
// Well, the var keyword makes our variable local.  It restricts its scope
// to a function or file if it is declared outside the function.  Ommitting the
// var keyword will make your variable available to you whole Meteor app.
// This can be good, but in most cases it is not.
